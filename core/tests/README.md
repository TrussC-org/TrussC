# core/tests

Headless **behavioral regression tests** for the TrussC core. Each test's
`main()` returns non-zero on failure. CI builds and runs every `core/tests/*/`
here (`build_all.py --core-tests-only`); a non-zero exit fails the job. This is
the same convention bundled addons use (`addons/*/tests/`).

This is the *behavioral* tier — it complements, and does not replace, the
**build canaries** in `examples/tests/` (e.g. `AllFeaturesExample`), which prove
the API still compiles/links/instantiates but do not assert runtime behaviour.

## What belongs here

- A test guards **one invariant or one fixed bug** — a contract a future refactor
  could silently break while still compiling. Not "exercise the API for coverage"
  (that's what `AllFeaturesExample` is for).
- **Fast and headless** — no window/GPU. Use plain `main()` for pure-logic checks,
  or `runHeadlessApp<App>()` when you need a realistic `setup()`/`update()` runtime
  (it runs the per-frame `internal::drainMainThreadQueue()`, so `runOnMainThread` works).
- **Assertion-based**, clear names, exit code = pass/fail.

## Two test shapes

1. **trusscli project tests** (default) — a `src/` dir; built via `trusscli` and
   linked against libTrussC. `threadSafety/` is one.
2. **Standalone CMake unit tests** — a committed `CMakeLists.txt` with source at
   the dir root (no `src/`); built with plain `cmake`, **not** linked against
   libTrussC. Use this when a test must compile a library directly with options
   that would clash with the copy already baked into libTrussC — e.g. driving
   `sokol_gl` on `SOKOL_DUMMY_BACKEND` (no GPU) to assert GPU-resource
   accounting. `build_all.py` tells the two apart by the committed `CMakeLists.txt`
   + absence of `src/`, and runs both under `--core-tests-only`.

### Also on web (`web-test` marker)

A trusscli project test that also has a `web-test` file in its dir is built for
WebAssembly too and run under **node** (`build_all.py --web-only
--core-tests-only`; in CI, the daily run's `sweep-web` job, not the per-PR
lane). Use it when the invariant lives in
web-only code (`#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__`), which the web example builds only ever
compile. The test is the regular web app build (Emscripten's default
environment includes node), so it must not touch the canvas / GPU: plain
`main()` and no drawing. It still runs natively under `--core-tests-only`, so
give the native side something real to check (or an explicit skip).
Locally: source `emsdk_env.sh` first (for `emcmake` and `EMSDK_NODE`).

## Keep it curated (avoid rot)

- Default workflow: **when you fix a bug, add the regression test that would have
  caught it.**
- **Delete a test when its invariant becomes obsolete** (feature removed, contract
  intentionally changed). A stale suite is worse than a small one.

## Tests

- `threadSafety/` — main-thread affinity: `runOnMainThread` defers + delivers on
  the main thread, `Event` `Deliver::Main` marshals worker-fired notifies onto the
  main thread, and `Node::destroy()` is safe from any thread.
- `threadLifecycle/` — destroying a `tc::Thread` never calls `std::terminate`
  (#257): not after its worker returned on its own, not after only
  `stopThread()`, not right after `startThread()` (the worker skips
  `threadedFunction()` instead of calling the pure virtual), not after a
  restart, and, for a subclass that does not wait, not on its own worker:
  from its `threadedFunction()` (the base destructor detaches instead of
  joining itself, and the worker writes nothing to the freed object) or at
  worker exit when a `thread_local` `shared_ptr` on the worker was its last
  owner. A subclass that
  calls `waitForThread()` in its own destructor never has `threadedFunction()`
  running after its members are gone, and the base destructor logs exactly one
  warning when the subclass did not wait, including after only `stopThread()`
  and right after `startThread()` (also when the worker skipped
  `threadedFunction()`). Not covered: a waiting subclass destroyed on its own worker,
  from its `threadedFunction()` or by a `thread_local` owner at thread exit (it
  still terminates, see the "Destruction" notes in `tcThread.h`), and a
  destruction at the very moment the worker calls `threadedFunction()`.
- `audioDiagnostics/` — a play the AudioEngine refuses is never silent (#231):
  `Sound::play()` returns false for every drop reason, drops are counted and
  reach the TrussC logger (rate limited, and only from the main thread — an
  off-main drop is counted and reported by `runHeadlessApp`'s own frame pump;
  its exit flush and `AudioEngine::shutdown()` log what the rate limit held
  back), the audio thread's meters (peak / RMS / clipped samples / voice
  level / load) work and shutdown clears them, a reused `SoundBuffer`'s
  `getPath()` follows its last fill (memory / PCM / generated fills clear it),
  and `tc_get_audio_state` reports it all, the microphone included. Runs on
  miniaudio's null backend (`internal::setNullAudioBackendForTests()`), so no
  sound card is needed. A `.ogg` file that is not Ogg Vorbis fails with
  `DecodeFailed` and is closed once (counted on Linux by `src/fcloseProbe.cpp`).
- `sglLayerUpload/` — *(standalone, dummy backend)* the sokol_gl `_sgl_draw()`
  vertex upload is done **once per frame** and shared across layer draws, instead
  of re-appending the whole vertex set per layer. Guards against the O(N layers ×
  V vertices) GPU-buffer blow-up that grew the buffer until allocation failed
  (Metal `id:52`), the root cause of disappearing deferred 2D/PBR content.
- `screenshotContract/` — *(also on web)* the screenshot APIs report what they
  actually do (#230). Web: `grabScreen()` / `saveScreenshot()` return false,
  nothing is queued or created, and each API warns once. Native:
  `saveScreenshot()` still creates the destination folder, queues the capture
  and returns true. The per-PR CI runs only the native half, which passes with
  or without the #230 fix: it catches the web early return leaking into native
  builds. The web half is what guards #230; the daily run (`daily.yml`,
  `sweep-web`) runs it under node.
- `frameTiming/` — time handling (#228, #229): one steady elapsed clock with its
  origin at program start, `resetElapsedTimeCounter()` as a display offset only,
  `getFrameElapsedTime()` constant within a frame (through the main loop's frame
  start); fixed-Hz update steps report the nominal `1/updateFps`, catch-up is
  capped at `setMaxUpdateSteps()` steps per frame (default 10, `<= 0` runs
  every step; also per `runHeadlessApp` pass at any rate: the pass sleeps
  only until the next step is due, on a timer that doesn't round up to a
  ~15.6 ms Windows tick, so 1 kHz keeps up), each loop warning once, without
  starving `runOnMainThread` work; runtime mode switches
  don't replay old time and re-applying the current rates every frame changes
  nothing; `getFrameRate()` is the measured rate (steady at non-integer ratios;
  also in the default draw-synced mode, the independent VSYNC update and
  headless); the fixed-fps draw skip doesn't drop frames at the display rate;
  Node timers are countdowns that keep their phase and are not charged for
  time before they were created, and `callEveryCatchUp` fires once per due
  interval up to its limit (a cancel from the callback stops it); the
  `ScreenRecorder` pacer (its `start()`/`tick()` are all the timing
  `ScreenRecorder` reads) stays exact after long uptime and, like the
  `tc_get_health` uptime, ignores `resetElapsedTimeCounter()`.
- `nodeRemoval/` — node lifetime in mouse dispatch (#255): the window context
  holds the hovered / grabbed / selected node weakly and dispatch holds a
  strong reference while handlers run, so a node freed by `removeChild()` /
  `removeAllChildren()` is never touched by the next hover update, drag or
  release and `getSelectedNode()` returns null; a handler or `Event` listener
  that removes its own node or an ancestor (grab release and drag, the
  press / release / move / scroll bubbling, mouseEnter / mouseLeave) runs on
  a live node, its mods still get the event (checked for the grab release),
  and the node is freed when dispatch returns;
  `isMouseOver()` / `getSelectedNode()` never match a new node at a freed
  node's address, and `setSelectedNode()` with a node no `shared_ptr` owns
  clears the selection. Working code is unchanged: a removed node the app
  still holds gets its Leave, reparenting fires no extra Enter / Leave,
  `destroy()` drops hover / grab / selection at once. Runs in a secondary
  window's context and in the main one. A freed probe's memory holds a
  sentinel node that counts any call reaching it, so a stale pointer fails
  the test instead of depending on heap reuse.
- `appRoot/` — the running App is `getRootNode()` (#255): the root is a weak
  reference, so the App can't register itself from its constructor, and the
  code that creates it through a `shared_ptr` does. `runApp()`'s setup
  callback (called here without `sapp_run()`) registers the App, and the
  root is gone once the cleanup callback freed it. Inside the App's
  constructor `getRootNode()` is not the App yet and `App::setSize()`
  resizes no window and warns once however often it is called (an App on
  the stack likewise); from `setup()` it goes to the main window without a
  warning. `runHeadlessApp()` owns
  the App with a `shared_ptr`, so it is the root in `setup()`, `update()` and
  `cleanup()`, `setup()` can `addChild()`, and the root is cleared when the
  run ends.
- `pixelsIndex/` — `Pixels` indexes with `size_t`, so images past `INT_MAX`
  bytes work: the offset of the far corner of a 23171x23171 RGBA image, and
  an `allocate()` byte count that is checked before it can wrap (against a
  32-bit limit too, standing in for wasm32). A size that would wrap, a
  negative one, or a channel count other than 1-4 logs an error and leaves the
  buffer empty, and `crop()` / `Image::allocate()` stop there. With 64-bit
  `size_t` and at least 4 GiB of memory available (on Linux, the lower of
  `MemAvailable` and the cgroup v2 `memory.max` headroom), it also allocates real buffers just past 2 GiB and checks
  `getColor()` / `setColor()` at the far corner and `halve()` reading pixels
  past `INT_MAX` (about 6 s, 2.6 GB peak); otherwise that part prints SKIP.
