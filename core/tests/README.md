# core/tests

Headless **behavioral regression tests** for the TrussC core. Each test's
`main()` returns non-zero on failure. CI builds and runs every `core/tests/*/`
here (`build_all.py --core-tests-only`); a non-zero exit fails the job. This is
the same convention bundled addons use (`addons/*/tests/`).

This is the *behavioral* tier — it complements, and does not replace, the
**build canaries** in `examples/tests/` (e.g. `AllFeaturesExample`), which prove
the API still compiles/links/instantiates but do not assert runtime behaviour.

## What belongs here

- A test guards **one invariant or one fixed bug** — a contract a future refactor
  could silently break while still compiling. Not "exercise the API for coverage"
  (that's what `AllFeaturesExample` is for).
- **Fast and headless** — no window/GPU. Use plain `main()` for pure-logic checks,
  or `runHeadlessApp<App>()` when you need a realistic `setup()`/`update()` runtime
  (it runs the per-frame `drainMainThreadQueue()`, so `runOnMainThread` works).
- **Assertion-based**, clear names, exit code = pass/fail.

## Two test shapes

1. **trusscli project tests** (default) — a `src/` dir; built via `trusscli` and
   linked against libTrussC. `threadSafety/` is one.
2. **Standalone CMake unit tests** — a committed `CMakeLists.txt` with source at
   the dir root (no `src/`); built with plain `cmake`, **not** linked against
   libTrussC. Use this when a test must compile a library directly with options
   that would clash with the copy already baked into libTrussC — e.g. driving
   `sokol_gl` on `SOKOL_DUMMY_BACKEND` (no GPU) to assert GPU-resource
   accounting. `build_all.py` tells the two apart by the committed `CMakeLists.txt`
   + absence of `src/`, and runs both under `--core-tests-only`.

## Keep it curated (avoid rot)

- Default workflow: **when you fix a bug, add the regression test that would have
  caught it.**
- **Delete a test when its invariant becomes obsolete** (feature removed, contract
  intentionally changed). A stale suite is worse than a small one.

## Tests

- `threadSafety/` — main-thread affinity: `runOnMainThread` defers + delivers on
  the main thread, `Event` `Deliver::Main` marshals worker-fired notifies onto the
  main thread, and `Node::destroy()` is safe from any thread.
- `sglLayerUpload/` — *(standalone, dummy backend)* the sokol_gl `_sgl_draw()`
  vertex upload is done **once per frame** and shared across layer draws, instead
  of re-appending the whole vertex set per layer. Guards against the O(N layers ×
  V vertices) GPU-buffer blow-up that grew the buffer until allocation failed
  (Metal `id:52`), the root cause of disappearing deferred 2D/PBR content.
